## Ideation

Context and Framing: One key lesson that we learned while creating and conducting user research for Aurora was the necessity to include context with each user experience decision and design conclusion. Acknowledging that our demographic are students aged approximately 14-28 and visually impaired, we stressed the necessity of conducting research studies to fully empathize with the user and their interaction process.

Being partially or fully visually impaired, our users had limited access to graphical user interfaces, and are
accustomed to using software that is incompatible with adaptive equipment.
To set context and frame the problem in our proposal for how Aurora should manifest on the iPhone X (using iOS
11.0 and later), we illustrated how peculiar the device dimensions were and how to ensure we were mindful of this throughout our research engineering and design process (See Figure 1).
Alongside this, our framing process and decision to create a mobile application came after consulting Javier Sanchez Sierra, from the Center for Computer Research and Acoustics at Stanford University, as we concluded that “the majority of existing mobile applications have been designed for sighted people.”

Noting this, we wished to empower visually impaired individuals through this discrepancy. Javier’s research led us to discover that in terms of design, “accessibility features are added as a new layer to the apps, acting as a patch that is placed over the initial design layer; iPhone and iPad devices use Voice Over feature to facilitate this accessibility.” Instead of making a mobile application that would require a re-design for visually or impaired users we held visually impaired users at the center of our product curation.

## User Research: 
Defining our users as partially or visually impaired students in secondary or post-secondary education aged
approximately 15-29 in North America.

Noting this, we concluded the following about visually impaired users in Canada:
1. 1 in 5 Canadians are living with a disability including 400,000+ individuals who are blind and/or have low vision.

Every year, more than 50,000 Canadians will lose their sight.
2. In 2006, approximately 816, 250 (3.2%) Canadians aged 15 and older reported having some type of seeing
limitation. 89% of these individuals aged 15-29 reported being enrolled in secondary or post-secondary and
noting that the difficulty of their disability in both secondary and post-secondary education.6
